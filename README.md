# vSWIM<sup>beta</sup> - A Virtual Solar Wind Monitor for Mars 

### IMPORTANT: This repository is currently in beta and has been released for the peer review process (as of February 1, 2024). 

This reposiory consists of the source code to generate predictions of the upstream solar wind at Mars from [MAVEN](https://mars.nasa.gov/maven/) spacecraft data. 

### Contents

1. Hourly cadence solar wind predictions at [INSERT]. Use this if you need an [OMNI-like](https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/form/dx1.html) product at Mars.
2. Source code needed to generate predictions at [INSERT]. Use this if you need sub hour predictions of the solar wind at Mars.
3. A user guide for vSWIM.

 ### Hello World
 Hello world content goes here

The following describes the suggested uses and limitations of the vSWIM model. It follows a rough standard AI model reporting in model card format (see [Mitchell et al., 2015](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287560.3287596)). A more extensive overview can be found within [Azari et al., 2024](PENDING).

#### Model Description

Overview: This model is a Gaussian process regression on high-resolution upstream data from MAVEN SWIA and MAG from 2014 up to present.

Original data source: See [Halekas+2017](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JA023167), [Halekas+2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-013-0029-z), [Connerney+2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-015-0169-4) and [online](https://homepage.physics.uiowa.edu/~jhalekas/drivers.html) for original data).
