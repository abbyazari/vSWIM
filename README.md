# vSWIM<sup>beta</sup> - A Virtual Solar Wind Monitor for Mars 

### IMPORTANT: This repository is currently in beta and has been released for the peer review process (as of February 1, 2024). 

This repository contains predictions of the solar wind upstream of Mars from late 2014 onwards as calculated from [MAVEN](https://mars.nasa.gov/maven/) spacecraft data and a machine learning model.  

### Contents

1. **Low Resolution Data:** Hourly cadence solar wind predictions at [INSERT]. Use this if you need an [OMNI-like](https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/form/dx1.html) product at Mars.
2. **Code:** Source code needed to generate predictions at [INSERT]. Use this if you need sub hour predictions of the solar wind at Mars.
3. **Usage Guidelines:** A short user guide for vSWIM. Read this if you need to use either 1 or 2.

 ### 1. Model Description
 
The following describes the suggested uses and limitations of the vSWIM model. It follows a rough standard AI model reporting in model card format (see [Mitchell et al., 2015](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287560.3287596)). A more extensive overview can be found within [Azari et al., 2024](PENDING).

#### Model Description

Overview: This model is a Gaussian process regression on high-resolution upstream data from MAVEN SWIA and MAG from 2014 up to present.

Original data source: See [Halekas+2017](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JA023167), [Halekas+2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-013-0029-z), [Connerney+2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-015-0169-4) and [online](https://homepage.physics.uiowa.edu/~jhalekas/drivers.html) for original data).
